# Version 2.0.0

- This version allows users to upload videos that they wish to transcode to the service using the `POST /transcode/new` endpoint.
- Once transcoding is completed, uploaded file is removed from the local `fs`.
- Since this project will be running locally, users can adjust the `src` path in the `./index.html` file to right `.m3u8` frile from the `dist` folder (generated by running `npx ts-build`)

# Version 1.0.0

- Transcode videos stored on your local fs and generate corresponding `.hls` and `.ts` chunk files
